# Chapt. 15 Distributed Mutual Exclusion

## Operations
enter -> access -> exit
	
## Criteria:
1. Bandwidth: proportional to number of messages sent in enter & exit operation
2. Client delay:
3. Throughput: it's greater when synchronization delay is shorter.
   (synchronization delay is delay between one process exiting and another process entering)
